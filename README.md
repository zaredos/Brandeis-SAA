# Brandeis-SAA
 A website I created for COSI 152A which acts as the Brandeis University Students and Alumni Association site. This site uses express and node as a basic framework to the site, and stores all data using Mongoose. User authentication and authorization, CRUD operations, flash messages, chat functionality, CSS elements, routing, Events/Jobs are used.
